        I vividly recall the disbelief that nearly overwhelmed me. There we stood, on the enchanting platform of <span
          class="accentBold">Gare de
          Lyon in Paris.</span> At that time, I was a young Parisian governess, employed by a wealthy businessman who
        had to
        travel to Cairo for a while. And I was to accompany him! It was 9 o'clock in the evening, and within half an
        hour, the train would depart. <span class="accentBold">From Paris all the way to Cairo in just 6 days!</span> A
        mixture of fear and excitement
        engulfed me.

        The journey from Paris to Istanbul took only three days because the train ran day and night. I had expected a
        tiring journey, but the ease and comfort astonished me.<span class="accentBold"> At the
          beginning of the journey, the train conductor collected all the necessary documents, sparing us from being

        In Belgrade, the two cars destined for that journey were uncoupled, immediately replaced by two others: one from
        Berlin and one via Vienna. This gave us the opportunity to enjoy the enchanting view in Belgrade.

          Admittedly, our journey from Istanbul to Cairo was somewhat less comfortable than from Paris to Istanbul. It
          took about the same time, but <span class="accentBold">we were immersed in a strange, exotic culture,</span>
          so I
          certainly had no reason to
          complain. First, we traveled with the Taurus Express to Tripoli in Lebanon. Then, we continued with Rolls
          Royce buses to Haifa in Palestine. Next was a train journey to Kantara at the Suez Canal, where we took a
          ferry. A final train took us to Cairo. From Paris to our final destination, we needed four trains, two
          ships,
          a bus, and six days. In modern times, this seems unthinkable, but back then, it was truly impressively
          swift!

                  I feel compelled to share with you the extraordinary tale of an experience that seems to have
                  transcended the boundaries of time and luxury. A journey that unfolded on the Venice
                  Simplon-Orient-Express, a train that boasts of Grand Suites rumored to be among the "most expensive
                  hotel rooms" in the world, per square meter.
                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Grand Suites and Cost</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  Imagine, if you will, a journey from Venice to London, where each square meter of the Grand Suites
                  costs a staggering 24,000 euros. It was an escapade that whisked me away from the mundane, as if I
                  held Willy Wonka's golden ticket, granted to me by the esteemed Belmond, the luxury purveyor of this
                  magnificent train.

                <h5 class="popUpSub">History of Carriage 3309</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  The carriage, numbered 3309, whispered tales of yesteryears. A sleeper car from 1926 that once
                  traversed the routes connecting Paris to Bucharest and Munich to Istanbul, marooned in a snowdrift
                  outside Istanbul for five days in 1929, an incident immortalized by Agatha Christie in "Murder on the
                  Orient Express." This carriage now houses the Budapest Suite, a veritable work of art on wheels.
                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Budapest Suite Details</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  This carriage now houses the Budapest Suite, a veritable work of art on wheels. Embroidered silks
                  mingled with Lalique glass and Baccarat crystal, creating an ambiance that transcends mere opulence.
                  The mirrors alone, a hefty 27,000 euros each, whispered secrets of the past. In this mobile haven,
                  guests are greeted with Veuve Clicquot Saint Petersbourg Champagne and Steluga Tsar Imperial caviar,
                  enjoyed at their leisure throughout the journey. The suite, adorned with onyx, marble, and Murano
                  glass, promises an experience that lingers like the notes of a cherished melody.
                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Scenic Views</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  As the train gently rolled through Europe, the Budapest Suite's modest sofa became my sanctuary.
                  Through the large windows, the snowy Italian Alps, the chalets of Austria's Brenner Pass, the green
                  pastures of Switzerland, and the vineyards of France unfolded like scenes from a vintage film.
                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Culinary Experience</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  But the allure wasn't just visual. The culinary symphony orchestrated by Chef Jean Imbert in the
                  six-meter-long, one-meter-wide kitchen was nothing short of magic. From the Champagne breakfast to the
                  four-course dinner, each dish felt like a work of art.
                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Quirks and Conclusion</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy popUpBodyCopy_end">
                  Yet, the journey wasn't without its quirks. The Budapest Suite's spacious ensuite bathroom was a
                  charming but cozy affair. Yet, these were trifles, whispers in the wind when compared to the grandeur
                  of the entire experience.

                  The question that lingered in the air, like the echoes of a bygone era, was whether a nearly $28,000
                  journey for a single night could be justified. The answer, my dear, lies not just in the opulence but
                  in the historic tapestry woven through this slow, elegant travel.

                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  Hello There,

                  I trust this letter finds you well, wrapped in the gentle embrace of life's joys. Today, I am bursting
                  with excitement to share the tale of my recent sojourn aboard the legendary Orient Express. Allow me
                  to introduce myself; Eleanor is my name, a wanderer captivated by the allure of timeless journeys and
                  the enchantment of days gone by.

                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Boarding and Transition</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  Picture this: our adventure kicked off on the platform of a historic European city. The air was thick
                  with anticipation as we boarded the Orient Express, its carriages exuding a magnetic charm. The
                  conductor, a paragon of old-world grace, orchestrated our seamless transition. Bags in the hands of
                  porters, we were on the brink of setting forth into a realm of enduring elegance and timeless allure.
                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Dining Delights</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  Once aboard, the dining carriage became my sanctuary—a haven of gastronomic delights curated by the
                  talented Chef Jean Imbert. The rhythmic motion of the train accompanied each delightful morsel,
                  creating an ambiance of pure delight.

                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Evening Entertainment</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  As evening descended, our enchanting journey continued in Bar Car '3674.' Cocktails flowed, and the
                  piano serenaded us into the night. Amidst laughter and the rustle of elegant dresses, the metallic
                  blue crépe and the harmonious symphony of the night unfolded.

                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Midnight Brunch</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  Midnight brought with it an unexpected delight brunch. Lobster rolls and truffle club sandwiches were
                  served in Bar Car '3674,' a sumptuous affair that transcended into the night. The pianist played on,
                  serenading us until the last reveler decided to bid the night farewell.

                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Historic Cabins</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  In the hush that followed the night's revelry, I found solace in the historic cabins, each one
                  meticulously restored to the grandeur of the 1920s. Crisp sheets embraced me, cocooning me in the
                  whispers of history.
                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Dawn and New Beginnings</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  With the dawn of a new day came the aroma of coffee and pastries served in my cabin. A comforting
                  start, heralding the promise of new beginnings on the horizon.

                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Scenic Views</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  Peering through the windows, nature unveiled its splendors rolling hills and awe-inspiring Alpine
                  mountains. It was as if the world itself was putting on a show for those fortunate enough to be
                  aboard.

                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Exploration of Carriages<h5>
                    <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                      Wandering through the opulent carriages, each with its unique charm, I stumbled upon hidden
                      corners—a boutique, look-out points—each nook telling a story, inviting exploration and building
                      an appetite for the wonders yet to be revealed.

                    </p>
                    <h5 class="popUpSub">Lavish Lunch<h5>
                        <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                          Lunch unfolded as a lavish affair in the dining carriages. Three decadent courses accompanied
                          spirited conversation and a touch of Chardonnay. Dining on the Orient Express is a symphony of
                          flavors, an experience that lingers on the palate.


                        </p>
                        <h5 class="popUpSub">Conclusion</h5>
                        <p class="popUpBodyCopy popUpBodyCopy_end">
                          As our journey approached its end in a new city waiting to be explored, the excitement
                          remained palpable. There was always time for one final cocktail, one last toast to the
                          memories crafted on this extraordinary voyage.

                <h5 class="popUpSub">Kitchen Dynamics</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  The kitchen, a realm where even dishwashers were held to the highest standards, became a place where
                  skills blossomed, and responsibilities grew with expertise—a journey that made every workday a blast.

                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  Our workplace was a mix of flexibility and fun. Mornings were for surfing, afternoons for rejuvenating
                  naps, and evenings for crafting culinary delights before stepping out for the night.

                  an exhilarating touch to our routine, keeping us on our toes and pushing our limits.
                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Camaraderie in the Kitchen</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  What made it truly special was the camaraderie among the kitchen staff. We weren't just colleagues; we
                  were a tight-knit family navigating dinner rushes together, sharing triumphs and creating memories.

                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Discovering Excellence</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  In the heart of the Orient Express kitchen—a space filled with precision and a bit of chaos—I
                  discovered that excellence in culinary artistry could emerge from the smallest kitchen space. The
                  challenges of a tiny kitchen became the canvas for creating plates of artistry and finesse.

                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Satisfaction in Contribution</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  The rush of the dinner service was undeniable, but the satisfaction of contributing to a unique and
                  historic journey made it all worthwhile. As plates left the kitchen for the Budapest Suite and other
                  grand carriages, I felt a part of something truly extraordinary.

                </p>
                <h5 class="popUpSub">Kitchen Atmosphere</h5>
                <p class="popUpBodyCopy">
                  Surrounded by the clatter of pots and pans, the aroma of exquisite cuisine, and the camaraderie of my
                  kitchen companions, I found more than just a job; it was an adventure filled with flavors, challenges,
                  and the joy of being part of a team that turned each meal into a work of art.
